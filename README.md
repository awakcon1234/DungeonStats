A comprehensive statistics and leaderboard system for the **Infinity Dungeons** map. Track player high scores, monster kills, and total playtime with in-game leaderboards and a powerful RESTful API for developers.

---

This plugin is designed to bring a competitive edge to your Infinity Dungeons rogue-like server. It adds a robust statistics system to:
*   **Track Player Progress:** Automatically records each player's highest dungeon level, total kills, and total playtime.
*   **Foster Competition:** Display dynamic leaderboards in your world using floating text (holograms) to show off the top players.
*   **Engage Your Community:** Players can check their own stats or compare themselves against the server's best.
*   **Provide Developer Tools:** A built-in RESTful API allows you to pull stats for use on websites, Discord bots, or other custom integrations.

## ✨ Features

*   **Player Statistics Tracking:** Monitors and saves crucial data for every player's run in the dungeon.
    *   Highest Dungeon Level Reached
    *   Total Monster Kills
    *   Total Playtime
*   **In-Game Leaderboards:**
    *   Highly configurable floating text displays (holograms) for top kills, playtime, and max level.
    *   Choose between a single, rotating hologram or multiple static ones.
    *   Customize titles, colors, and formats.
*   **Player Commands:**

## 🧩 PlaceholderAPI Placeholders

This plugin provides placeholders via PlaceholderAPI (optional). If PlaceholderAPI is installed, placeholders are registered automatically on server start.

Identifier: `dungeonstats`

Player placeholders (use the player context where the placeholder is parsed):
- %dungeonstats_kills% → player total kills
- %dungeonstats_playtime% → player total playtime in seconds
- %dungeonstats_maxlevel% → player highest dungeon level reached

Top leaderboards (metric is one of: `kills`, `playtime`, `maxlevel`; index `n` starts at 1):
- %dungeonstats_top_<metric>_<n>% → player name at rank n
- %dungeonstats_top_<metric>_<n>_name% → player name at rank n
- %dungeonstats_top_<metric>_<n>_value% → value at rank n

Examples:
- %dungeonstats_top_kills_1_name% → name of the #1 by kills
- %dungeonstats_top_kills_1_value% → their kill count
- %dungeonstats_top_playtime_3% → name of the #3 by playtime
- %dungeonstats_top_maxlevel_10_value% → highest level of the #10

Notes:
- Playtime is returned as raw seconds for maximal compatibility with scoreboard plugins. Format it as desired.
- Placeholders work in plugins that support PAPI (scoreboards, chat, holograms, etc.).

## 🔌 RESTful API Documentation

If `api-server.enabled` is set to `true`, the plugin will host a simple API server on the configured port. **This discloses game data to a remote server connection and must be firewalled appropriately if you do not want it to be public.**
